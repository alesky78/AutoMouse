AutoMouse keeps Windows sessions active by triggering configurable mouse movements. 
Built in Java, it exposes both a console interface and a Swing UI so each user can choose 
the workflow that fits their automation needs.

Core Features
 - Adjustable movement distance to mimic natural cursor activity.
 - Customizable interval between each simulated movement.
 - Configurable auto-stop slots to pause and restart the automation on schedule.
 - Dual launch scripts: one for headless console usage, one for the Swing application.
